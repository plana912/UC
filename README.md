05/13/24 The assignment 5.1 work is in the Jupyter Notebook. I added notes for Findings in response to the questions that were asked.  Though one of the summary findings was that about 68% to 72% seemed to be the rate of coupon acceptance for many of the groups in the assignment, with some execptions.

Note: I placed a support ticket and got a delayed response. Though it did not answer my question. So I was delayed in getting this work done. 
Note: I saw several questions were I understand how to code an answer, however, the questions ASSUME context sometimes and it makes answering them difficult for the wrong reasons. E.g., where it says things like this set of attributes and compare it to the other. Well, "other" could me other in that data subset, or other in a larger data set. So it can be confusing.
If I missed anything in this assignment multiple times it will be because of this issue I am noting and I would like a change to redue the work for credit once graded.
