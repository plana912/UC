My Summary Results for Practical Application Assignment Module 18

After running four different models with multiple parameters for each model in a GridSearchCV I found most all models produced a 91% success for determining the class against the test data. 
Note the SVC model took much longer to run than the other three. For actual use of the trained models all though would produce equivalent results. 
So I would focus the selection more on the speed and efficiency of computational performance than the accuracy scores. See the Jupyter Notebook I created in this repository for more details. 
Therefore I would go with Decision Tree or Logistic Regression as the chosen model.
Also, note I showed the strongest feature correlation was with Duration of call to potential customers in the marketing campaign as opposed to the number of calls to the customer.
